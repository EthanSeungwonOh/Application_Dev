# Wireless_Cellular_Environment_Simulation
Python script simulating the downlink behavior of an umbrella base station, a macro cell base station with a small cell co-located on the same tower. The base station is designed to cover a shopping center and a nearby multi-lane highway. The idea in planning this base station was that the small cell would pick up most of the shopping center traffic, while the macro cell would handle most of the highway traffic. You run this script to investigate the behavior of this design and explore cell capacity and other factors. 

## Simulation Details
The road runs east-west with the base station 1km to the north. The users are assumed to be either on the road or at random locations in the shopping center. Your program will simulate the users as they make calls, hand off between the two cells, and terminate calls.
