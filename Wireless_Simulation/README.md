# Wireless_Cellular_Environment_Simulation
a Python application which will simulate the downlink behavior of an umbrella base station, that is, a macro cell base station with a small cell co-located on the same tower. The base station is designed to cover a shopping center (multiple small stores) and a nearby multilane highway. The idea in planning this base station was that the small cell would pick up most of the shopping center traffic while the macro cell would handle most of the highway traffic. You will use your application to investigate the behavior of this arrangement and explore capacity and other effects. The road runs east-west with the base station 1km to the north. The users are assumed to be either on the road or at random locations in the shopping center. Your program will simulate the users as they make calls, hand off between the two cells, and terminate calls.
